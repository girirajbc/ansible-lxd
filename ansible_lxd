I am running ansible on local machine and have a different server setup for LXD server. Does anyone have ansible playbook or roles where i can install web server like nginx inside LXD container?
Note:
lxd version: 4.0
ansible version: 4.0 or 2.11 ansible-core
Lxd container: ubuntu 20.04
ansible remote host: ubuntu 20.04
